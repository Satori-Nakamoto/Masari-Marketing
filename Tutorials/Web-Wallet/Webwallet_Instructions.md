It is advisable to pick a password that is complex, as you could lose your funds if a malevolent person logs into your wallet. When ready, click 'Use this password'.

**Mnemonic Phrase**

After choosing a password, you will be prompted to either download a file of or write down your mnemonic phrase.

Make sure to keep a copy (or multiple copies) at all times in a secure place, as your wallet cannot be recovered if you lose it. Also, never share this information with anyone except trusted parties. If you understand these risks, click 'I Understand. Continue.'.
